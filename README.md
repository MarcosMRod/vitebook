**ARCHIVED**

Due to a lack of time, resources, and change in direction this repository is no longer maintained. I'm sorry for any issues that were unresolved and for not being able to help as much as I wanted too. The work that was started here is continued in another OSS project called [Vessel](https://github.com/vessel-js/vessel). 

If you're still looking for a Storybook alternative that's powered by Vite, I highly recommend checking out [Histoire](https://histoire.dev/). 

---

If you're unfamiliar with Storybook, it's an open source tool for building UI components and
pages in isolation. It streamlines UI development, testing, and documentation. Vitebook aims
to provide the same capabilities but in a more laxed, lighter, faster and configurable way.

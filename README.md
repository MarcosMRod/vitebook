# Vitebook

[![package-badge]][package]

> ðŸš¨&nbsp;&nbsp;Vitebook is still in early stages of development, so this means you can expect bugs
> and certain [features to be missing](#missing-features). As much as we'll try not to break
> existing API's, occasionally it _might_ happen.
Vitebook is a fast and lightweight alternative to [Storybook][storybook] that's
powered by [Vite][vite]. If you'd like to explore more about Vite vs traditional bundlers/dev
environments such as [Webpack][webpack], check out [Why Vite][vite-why].

If you're unfamiliar with Storybook, it's an open source tool for building UI components and
pages in isolation. It streamlines UI development, testing, and documentation. Vitebook aims
to provide the same capabilities but in a more laxed, lighter, faster and configurable way.
